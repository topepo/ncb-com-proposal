    "text": "Proposal\nI propose that the tools to use for NCB communication be simpler, modern, and functional. I suggest using Quarto1 and GitHub2 as the primary mechanisms to achieve this.\nThe goal is to improve tooling; I’m not suggesting any change in roles or personnel within NCB.\nSpecifics:\n\nAcquire URLs for a main site and, optionally, a site for the biennial NCB conference. ncbiostats.org is open ($10/y) as is ncb-conf.org ($10/y).\nCreate an ncbiostats GitHub organization (free)\nHave volunteers create the initial NCB website.\nExtensively document how the site functions, along with templates for common tasks (e.g., news items).\nDeploy site preview for review and comments.\nDeploy and communicate the new site.\nForward the current ASA site to the new independent site.\n\nAfter getting the current site’s files, I believe a new site draft would take 1-2 weeks, and documentation would take 1-2 months.\n\nBenefits\n\nThe site will be easier to maintain and update.\nA modern web framework is used to provide security and accessibility.\nRequires a low technical barrier with no coding.\nGitHub enables users/contributors to collaborate easily and efficiently.\n\nPrevious content can be migrated without much trouble,\nImproved SEO to help attract more visitors.\nURLs are easy to remember and access.\n\n\n\nDrawbacks\n\nAdditional yearly cost is $20.\nSomething new to learn.\nFor accessibility, we’d need light and dark mode versions of logos and images."

    "text": "Open questions\nWe can easily deploy the site(s) to custom URLs via GitHub. Another option is Netlify, which can provide deployment previews to test/review the published site before “going live.” We can get a free Netlify account for nonprofits/open-source projects. I would probably just use GitHub to avoid another dependency. If we think deployment previews are worth it, we can discuss Netlify.\nThe ASA may have a graphic designer who might improve aesthetics (if needed)."

It was used to create and publish this proposal. See the code to make this document here.↩︎\nGitHub is a proprietary developer platform (owned by Microsoft) that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their projects. For NCB, it would help us collaborate and publish our content.↩︎"
